##W.Avy would like more information about temperature trends especially for the months of June and December in Oahu. 

###Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4

##Results

June records the higher min, max, mean temperature and smaller standard deviation so that temperature points are less scatter than in December.
